An emotional and personalized daily planning tool for students.
# 🎧 Rhythm – Beta Release

## 🧠 What Is Rhythm?

Rhythm is more than a productivity tool.  
It's an emotion-aware, personalized daily planner designed for students — acting like a **digital guardian** that understands their routine, mindset, and energy.

This is a **beta version** of a much larger vision.

We started with the most critical problem:
> “Students don’t just need time management — they need emotional guidance, motivation, and a daily system that adapts to their mental state.”

## 🔍 What This Beta Version Solves

- Users input their routine: wake-up, sleep, study/play hours
- They describe their **current emotion** or personal issue
- Rhythm responds with:
  - A smart, **realistic daily schedule**
  - A caring, **personalized motivational message**
  - A solution or quote based on how they feel

This version is fully working and demonstrates the **core emotional engine** of Rhythm.

## 🚧 What’s Coming Next

We’re already working on these features for our full release:

- 🔗 AI-generated guidance (ChatGPT-like responses)
- 📊 Mood history + emotion graph
- ⏱️ Streak tracking and consistency feedback
- 📥 Export schedule to PDF/email
- 📱 Mobile-ready UI with reminders
- 🧠 Adaptive learning: Rhythm gets smarter with use

## 🤝 Why We Built This

As students ourselves, we realized that most planning tools are robotic. They don’t talk, don’t care, and don’t adapt.

Rhythm was built to change that.

This beta version is the **first public step** in a much bigger journey — and we’re just getting started.
